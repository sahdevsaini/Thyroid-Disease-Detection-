# Thyroid Disease Detection

### Project Overview
This project is part of the Machine Learning internship at iNeuron.ai. The internship started on September 1, 2023, focusing on machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model for detecting thyroid disease using machine learning algorithms.

### Project Name
Thyroid Disease Detection

### Description
Thyroid disease is a common medical condition that affects many individuals worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis of thyroid disease are crucial for effective treatment and management. In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into different thyroid disease categories based on relevant features extracted from medical data.

### Project Phases
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant medical data containing features related to thyroid disease.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Preprocessing and transforming raw data into meaningful features suitable for model training.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among variables.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluating various machine learning algorithms for classification, including but not limited to Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, etc.
5. **Model Building**: Developing a Random Forest classifier based on the selected algorithm.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7. **Deployment**: Integrating the model into a deployable application or service for practical use.

### Selected Model
After performing extensive model selection, Random Forest emerged as the most suitable algorithm for thyroid disease classification due to its robustness and high performance.
